## Library Website

The Library Website is a comprehensive platform designed for managing and interacting with library resources. It allows users to browse and view detailed information about books available in the library. Readers can borrow and return books, rate them, and send messages to administrators. They can also view the books on their personal bookshelf and track their borrowing history. Administrators can add new books, remove existing ones, adjust the quantity of books, and respond to user inquiries.

### Key Features

- **Advanced Authentication and Security**: Utilized JWT, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect to ensure secure authentication and role-based access control, distinguishing between `USER` and `ADMIN` roles with appropriate permissions.
- **Real-Time CRUD Operations**: Enabled real-time Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing books and handling comments.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provided a comprehensive admin interface for managing books and replying to reader comments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed a responsive and accessible front-end with React and TypeScript, styled using Bootstrap for a consistent and optimal user experience.
- **Streamlined Backend Development**: Leveraged Spring Boot to simplify backend setup and configuration, ensuring a smooth development experience.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Used Spring Data JPA for easy interaction with the MySQL database, automating data access and manipulation. Spring Data REST was employed to optimize RESTful API development, automating endpoints and supporting custom extensions.
